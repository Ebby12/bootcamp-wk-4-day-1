Objectives:
[x] Create a classes using JavaScript class syntax and an instance of the class using the new keyword.
[x] Create a class that has properties set by a constructor using the this keyword and methods that return and update property values.
[x] Explain how Object Oriented Analysis and Class Diagrams can be used to represent classes.
[x] Create Node modules that utilize module.exports, require, and import.

Key Questions:
- Where have we seen the new keyword before?
  - in the constructor function way of creating an object
	- we are expanding upon that in this demo by creating a class
- What is the difference between a class and an object?
	- a class is a blueprint - it defines the properties and methods that each instance of the class should have
	- an object is a tangible instance of the class
- What is the structure to create a class in JavaScript? How do we create an instance of the class (an object)?
  - class ClassName { constructor (){} and methods}
	- to create an instance of the class: declare a variable and use the new keyword with the class name of the class that you want to make an instance for
- REVIEW: What is the constructor method?
	- this is the method that creates an object and initializes the properties of the object
- REVIEW: What does the 'this' keyword represent in a class definition?
	- ‘this’ in a class definition represents the object being created
- REVIEW: What is the difference between a function and a method?
	- a function can just be called with its name and the parentheses 
	- a method is performed on an object - it is called with the object.methodName()
- What is Object Oriented Analysis? Once we've completed OOA for a program, how can we use diagrams to represent class definitions? 
	- it is a strategy used in designing the structure of our program - it is how we decide what classes we will need, what objects we will want to use, and how each of our classes and objects will interact with each other
- What is a module in JavaScript?
	- a function or a group of similar functions in one file, that is reusable and exportable
- How do we make sure that our classes and functions can be used in other files throughout our codebase?
	- exporting with module.exports and importing with require
