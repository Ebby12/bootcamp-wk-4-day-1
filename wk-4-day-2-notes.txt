Objectives:
[] Explain what class inheritance is and how it represented in class diagrams.
[] Create a subclass from a parent class using the extends keyword and super() method.

- REVIEW: What is Node?
- REVIEW: How do we structure the parts of a class diagram?
- What is inheritance? What benefits does inheritance provide us in object-oriented programming?
- In a class diagram, how do we represent inheritance?
- In our code, how do we create a subclass that is inheriting from a parent class? Where does the super() keyword fit in this?
- What is the difference between a regular method and a static method? Why are static properties/methods important in our classes?
