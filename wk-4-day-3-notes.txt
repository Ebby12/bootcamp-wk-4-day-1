Objectives:
[] Apply private fields into classes and create constructor methods to update these values.
[] Create getter and setter methods to get and update private fields in a class.
[] Explain why and how user stories are used as part of the Software Development Lifecycle.

Key Questions:

- When might it be important to use a private variable instead of a public variable?
- How can we access these values in private fields?
- What is encapsulation? Why is it important in object-oriented programming?
- What is a user story? How do user stories help us further adapt our mindset as angineers?
